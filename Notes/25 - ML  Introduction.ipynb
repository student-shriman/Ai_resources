    " =>  Why Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "     The main aim of Unsupervised learning is to model the distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.\n",
    "       It is called so, because there is no correct answer and there is no such teacher(unlike supervised learning).\n",
    "     Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.\n",
    "        \n",
    " =>  Example of Unsupervised Learning -\n",
    "\n",
    "   ** Again, Suppose there is a basket and it is filled with some fresh fruits. The task is to arrange the same type of fruits\n",
    "         at one place.\n",
    "      This time there is no information about those fruits beforehand, its the first time that the fruits are being seen or\n",
    "         discovered So how to group similar fruits without any prior knowledge about those.\n",
    "\n",
    "   =>  First, any physical characteristic of a particular fruit is selected. Suppose color.\n",
    "         Then the fruits are arranged on the basis of the color.\n",
    "    \n",
    " =>  The job is done! Here, there is no need to know or learn anything beforehand. \n",
    "       That means, no train data and no response variable. This type of learning is known as Unsupervised Learning."

    "       #################   #############   Batch learning vs Online Learning    ###############    ###############\n",
    "    \n",
    " =>  In batch learning, the system is incapable of learning incrementally.\n",
    "     It must be trained using all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and computing resources, so it is\n",
    "      typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is launched into production and runs without learning\n",
    "        anymore; it just applies what it has learned. This is called offline learning.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  If you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of spam), you need to train a new version\n",
    "      of the system from scratch on the full dataset (not just the new data, but also the old data), then stop the old system \n",
    "       and replace it with the new one. Batch learning system can adapt to change. Simply update the data and train a new\n",
    "         version of the system from scratch as often as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  This solution is simple and often works fine, but training using the full set of data can take many hours, so \n",
    "      you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or even just weekly. If your system needs to adapt to rapidly\n",
    "      changing data (e.g., to predict stock prices), then you need a more reactive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  Also, training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPU, memory space, disk space, disk I/O, \n",
    "      network I/O, etc.). If you have a lot of data and you automate your system to train from scratch every day, it will\n",
    "     end up costing you a lot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a Batch Learning\n",
    "       algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  Finally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited resources (e.g., a smartphone application\n",
    "     or a rover on Mars), then carrying around large amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train\n",
    "      for hours every day is a showstopper.\n",
    "     Fortunately, a better option in all these cases is to use algorithms that are capable of learning incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or\n",
    "      by small groups called mini-batches. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on \n",
    "     the fly, as it arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  Online learning is great for systems that receive data as a continuous flow (e.g., stock prices) and need to adapt \n",
    "      to change rapidly or autonomously. It is also a good option if you have limited computing resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    " =>  Once an online learning system has learned about new data instances, it does not need them anymore, so you can\n",
    "      discard them (unless you want to be able to roll back to a previous state and “replay” the data). \n",
    "     This can save a huge amount of space.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  Online learning algorithms can also be used to train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine’s main memory \n",
    "      (This is called out-of-core learning). The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data,\n",
    "      and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " =>  One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data.\n",
    "     This is called the learning rate. If you set a high learning rate, then your system will rapidly adapt to new data,\n",
    "      but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data (you don’t want a spam filter to flag only the latest kinds of spam \n",
    "        it was shown).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conversely, if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it will learn more slowly, \n",
    "      but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers)."
